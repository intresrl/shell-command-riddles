This is an evolving repository. If you have an example you would like to share, feel free to submit a pull request!

Remember to put your exercise in a meaningfully named folder with a `README.md` file that explains the task and a `solution.md` file that shows how you solved the problem.

Optionally you can provide a `hints.md` file to point the reader in the right direction.

Also if you want to share a different solution to an existing problem submit a pull request adding it into the appropriate `solution.md` file.
