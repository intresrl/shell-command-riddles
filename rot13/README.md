Implement a rot13 cypher
========================

Rot 13 is a simple cypher wich translates every letter with the 13th letter after it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)

Write a script that cyphers standard input to standard output. You should be able to use it like

`echo cypher me | your_command`

and it should output `plcure zr`
